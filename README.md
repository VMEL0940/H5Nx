# Investigation of molecular evolution of global highly pathogenic avian influenza H5Nx 

This repository contains code and data for analyzing the impact of viral mutations on H5Nx hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) binding affinities to host sialic acids (Sia). Traditional phylogenetic approaches focus on mutation tracking, but they often overlook allosteric effects. Our structural analysis method enables a more detailed evaluation by predicting how mutations influence viral interactions with avian (α2-3-linked) and mammalian (α2-6-linked) sialic acids.

This approach supports real-time viral monitoring and public health responses by integrating sequence-based mutation analysis with structural insights.

## Key findings includes:
- Binding affinity of 2-3Sia may correlate with viral fitness.
- 2-6Sia affinity is higher in mammalian strains, indicating zoonotic potential.
- Structural modeling from a single sequence allows for rapid surveillance insights.
